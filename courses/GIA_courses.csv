"As the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) evolves, many companies are suffering financial distress as business disappears and cash flow dries up. The government has offered some relief for directors by amending the insolvency laws, especially by suspending the operation of the insolvent trading provisions. However, this does not give directors a licence to ignore their other duties. What will this mean for your company’s directors and officers? In this webinar our experts consider the government’s ‘regulatory shield’ and examine the flexibility and changes that will help businesses manage risks in the coming six months – and be best placed to come out the other side. Our experts:  Gavin Robertson, Principal, Macpherson Kelley Gavin Robertson is an experienced corporations and corporate regulatory lawyer. Starting his career in litigation, Gavin has since specialised in commercial law, in particular regulated transactions and governance matters, dealing with the Corporations Act, ASX listing rules and takeovers panel guidance.

"With the COVID-19 pandemic unfolding, companies have been working urgently on contingency plans for AGMs (or other General Meetings and Scheme Meetings). For many, this is new ground. They are looking at ways forward that still enable a reasonable opportunity for shareholders to participate in the meeting, to ask questions, make comments and to vote. There are options – but which is best? They must also consider the particular nature of their organisations and the provisions of their constitution. They will need to coordinate with share registries and venue providers and keep their shareholders fully informed and updated, giving them the maximum opportunity to have their say. In this webcast, our expert panel will unpack some of the challenges as well as looking at the key factors to take into account for sound planning.
